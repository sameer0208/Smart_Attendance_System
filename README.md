SMART ATTENDANCE PROJECT PLAN
Admin Panel:
An admin will be the person who will manage the attendance (Professor/Teacher/Event Handler). 
Steps:
1.	The interface will be having an option to create an event/topic e.g. if any faculty is taking class on 06-06-2024 they can just simply create a topic with name MySubject 6 June Attendance, after that new topic will be created.
2.	In this topic there will be an option of Start taking attendance which will create a QR Code which will be valid for short span of time to avoid sharing of QR and other malpractices (One QR will be valid for approx. 2 minutes), after that a new QR will be generated again. The procedure will be continued until the faculty click on Stop Taking Attendance button.
3.	The time when the procedure of attendance is going on the students needs to follow the Attendee Panel criteria which is explained below, if all the criteria is satisfied and student successfully submitted their attendance the details will be displayed to the admin under that topic in the form of table.

Attendee Panel:
Steps:
1.	Attendee like student needs to use their scanner and scan the QR. 
2.	Once they scanned, they will be directed to the webpage only if all the following criteria are met:
a.	They should be connected with the respective premises Wi-Fi.
b.	They should within the range of the QR Code, e.g. if the given range is 100 meters, then the students within that range can only proceed further (this will be done using Geolocation Verification). 
If any of the above criteria failed they will get an error message and they will not be allowed to submit their attendance.
3.	Then the student needs to enter their name and roll number and then click on submit.
4.	The student will get successful submission message and the details entered by the student will be shared with the respective Admin.
